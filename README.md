# JournalChat

This was a project done by myself, Abdo Elhosary, Ash Win, and Wei Wang for Lumohacks 2017.

## The Project

The idea was to create a chatbot style journaling web app for people at risk of relapsing into depression. To see the interface look at the pitch deck. The CSS is not responsive as we only had 6 hours to make it and chose to make it for a mobile view. 

## Built With

The team originally tried to write this with Ruby on Rails but when that fell apart; I rebuilt it with JavaScript and Bootstrap
