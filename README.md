# JournalChat

This was a project done by myself, Abdo Elhosary, Ash Win, and Wei Wang for Lumohacks 2017. All code is written by me. 

## The Project

The idea was to create a chatbot style journaling web app for people at risk of relapsing into depression. The CSS is not responsive as we only had 6 hours to make it and chose to make it for a mobile view.
